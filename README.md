## ChatGpt 的要求：
### Create a responsive landing page for a fictional e-commerce website called "EcoMart".

Goals:

  * The landing page should include a hero section with a background image and a call-to-action button.
  * There should be a section displaying featured products with their prices and ratings.
  * Include a section displaying customer testimonials.
  * The page should be fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.
  * Use appropriate HTML tags and semantic markup.
  * Use CSS to style the page and make it visually appealing.
  * Use JavaScript to add any necessary interactivity, such as a responsive navigation menu.

Minimum information:

  * EcoMart is an online store that sells eco-friendly products such as clothing, household items, and personal care products.
  * The hero image should be a high-quality image that represents the theme of the website.
  * The featured products section should display at least 4 products and their respective prices and ratings.
  * The customer testimonials section should include at least 3 testimonials with the name and photo of the customer.
  * The page should be optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
  * You can use any framework or library of your choice to complete the project.

And...
*   Yes, this is a static webpage. It doesn't have any dynamic data or backend functionality.
* As this is a fictional e-commerce website, I didn't provide specific product names or concepts for the featured products section. You can come up with your own product names and descriptions that align with the theme of the website, which is eco-friendly products. For example, you could feature products such as organic cotton t-shirts, reusable bamboo straws, natural cleaning products, or biodegradable phone cases. The products can be anything that you think would appeal to customers looking for eco-friendly options.
